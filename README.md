__What is Blindee?__

Blindee is a unique way to control your window blind from any web enabled device that is connected to the internet, such as a computer or mobile device.

__How does Blindee work?__

Blindee uses a Raspberry Pi which is an internet connected miniature computer. Connnected to the Raspberry Pi through it's GPIO pins is a stepper motor driver that controls a stepper motor.

The stepper motor is directly attached to the shaft of the roller blind which gives it full control over the movement of the roller blind.

The web interface that you use to control the blind and set up automatic tasks, such as opening and closing the blind at a specific time, is hosted in the cloud and directly communicates with an API on the Raspberry Pi.

__Features__
